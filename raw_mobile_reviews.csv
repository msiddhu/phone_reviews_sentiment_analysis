Good for average use and good option in no Chinese mobile
","

  I have compare a samsung, Panasonic, and MI mobile. Mi is better in terms of bettery (5000mah) but all the other specifications are same in this range. I prefer samsung because of brand value and I don't want to buy Chinese products.This Mobile is good for average use and battery last for 24 hour. No heating problem.

Best smart phone normal usage

  This smartphone is very handy and responsive. The cameras are not as good as other smartphones in this price but it gets the job done. If you want a very hand and easy to use smartphone this is it. The quality is the best in this segment.Pros:1. Small, handy and light weight2. Display is good3. battery capacity is good4. fast and responsive for normal tasks5. Durability ""It has a plastic body and looks premium but extremely light and durable""cons:1. Not for gaming2. charging takes 3 hours 30 minutes3. cameras are not good compared to other smartphones.

Good Phone at 9k

  I have been using it for a week.I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better.The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.A good to buy phone for  9000

  After watching so much negative reviews from paid youtubers about this Phone, I dare to buy this one because of my guts feeling, and I'm happy to have this phone. DON'T GET TRAPPED UNDER NUMEROUS FRAGILE FEATURES IN CHEAP PRICE BY OTHER COMPANIES. I ONLY WANT DURABILITY.

  The description said it had fingerprint recognition facility. But it didn't have the faciity. And that was one of the main reasons of deciding to buy it.
